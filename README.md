# MaliciousUrls

## Objective
The objective of this project was to explore the application of machine learning models for classifying URLs into different types, such as 'benign', 'phishing', 'defacement', and 'malware'.

To achieve this goal, a dataset of URLs was taken, and various machine learning algorithms were evaluated to determine their performance.
